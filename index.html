<p>Kunquat is a music sequencer similar to tracker programs. Some of its distinctive
features include high time resolution and flexible tuning configuration. Great care is
also taken in designing a mixing infrastructure to allow mixing logical bodies instead of
hardware forced channels.</p>
<p>The design is partially motivated by the desire to compose interactive music, that
reacts on changes in the environment where the music is played. Such factors might
include the events in a video game, or the amount of customers in a restaurant where the
music is played.</p>

<h3>Kunquat 0.9.2</h3>
<p>2018-08-03</p>
<p>
This is a bugfix release that fixes some issues that came up along the release of 0.9.1.
Also, the build procedure has been simplified slightly as the Fabricate build script is
now included as part of the Kunquat release package.
</p>

<h3>Kunquat 0.9.1</h3>
<p>2018-06-17</p>
<p>
This release of Kunquat contains some new signal processor features, bug fixes in the
sequencer, some polish in the tracker interface, and a major preparation towards a stable
file format.
</p>
<p>
The PADsynth now supports a resonance envelope for enhanced control of the audio spectrum
of the synth. New processors include an early iteration of a looping device as well as a
bitcrusher implementation.
</p>
<p>
The user interface of the tracker has improved in several small ways. The chord editing
mode in the composition sheet is now optional, with a more traditional single-column
editing mode as the default. Many number editing fields are now more convenient to use
and allow more precision where needed. Finally, the sample editor now contains a tool for
creating crossfaded loops.
</p>
<p>
The Kunquat file formats have gone through a major change that helps maintaining
backwards compatibility once the file formats have been stabilised. Unfortunately,
this change itself breaks compatibility with earlier Kunquat releases, but hopefully
this is the last time such a change is required.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in order to ease adoption for third-party developers, this release introduces
libkunquatfile, a C library that has a simple interface for loading Kunquat modules.
</p>

<h3>Kunquat 0.8.2</h3>
<p>2017-12-25</p>
<p>
This release of Kunquat is mostly a maintenance release with bug fixes in audio rendering
and user interface, small performance improvements, and some small new features.
</p>
<p>
The most important fixes include consistent application of composition random seed
(previous versions would fail to set this correctly at the initial start of playback),
generation of PADsynth waveforms in some corner cases, and user interface behaviour in
the composition sheet with custom grids and hits. The most notable new features include
support for channel muting and soloing in the tracker, and storing of default notation in
modules. Finally, signal processing is now faster when rendering audio in short sections,
and improved resource allocation allows increased polyphony with many complex instruments.
</p>

<h3>Music!</h3>
<p>2017-08-07</p>
<p>
We are delighted to present the very first (to our knowledge) complete composition made
with Kunquat Tracker:

</p>

<h3>Kunquat 0.8.1</h3>
<p>2017-08-04</p>
<p>
This release of Kunquat introduces many new audio synthesis and signal processing
capabilities, adds new ways to control instruments, improves usability, and brings a new
polished look for the tracker. Although there are still missing key features and some
details are subject to change, it is now possible to make full compositions of rich sound
quality with the tracker.
</p>

<p>
The tracker now supports traditional sample-based synthesis with sample selection based
on pitch, force and random chance. Other new software synthesis processors include
Karplus-Strong string synthesis as well as the PADsynth algorithm. Other new signal
processors include a simple delay and a range mapper that can be used to convert signals
between different value ranges.
</p>

<p>
The tracker also features new ways of controlling instruments. The most notable is the
hit interface that can be used to specify controls for drums and other non-melodic
instruments. The instrument expression interface can be used to specify different ways to
play a single instrument, which is especially useful with guitars and other similar
instruments. The old note interface has also been extended with editors for user-defined
scales and tunings.
</p>

<p>
In addition to new features in the synthesiser and sequencer, the tracker features
several usability improvements. The composition sheet now supports standard clipboard
operations as well as undo and redo. Also, testing of instruments is now easier with
extended controls and the ability to select a subgraph of an instrument to be played
inside the instrument editor. Finally, the user interface provides better feedback and
handles common error conditions more gracefully.
</p>

<p>
Many things have also changed in the lower level. The Kunquat library now optimises many
common signal processing patterns and supports multithreaded audio rendering,
significantly reducing the computation time required for playback. Also, the Kunquat
project has now migrated to Python 3 and the tracker interface uses the PyQt5 wrapper for
accessing the Qt toolkit.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we have begun the effort of adding macOS support. While it is not yet stable on
the platform and there are many rough edges in appearance, it should be possible to use
Kunquat Tracker for playing Kunquat modules.
</p>

<h3>Kunquat 0.7.1</h3>
<p>2016-01-23</p>
<p>
This release of Kunquat features major enhancements in composition editor, instrument and
signal processing editors and the audio synthesis pipeline. Other enhancements include
basic interactivity support and miscellaneous bug fixes. Despite all the work, Kunquat is
still in an early stage of development. However, we encourage you to try the tracker out
and let us know how you feel about it!
</p>

<p>
It is now possible to write compositions consisting of several patterns. All patterns of
a composition are displayed together in the sheet, helping the user see the full
structure of the composition. We have also reintroduced an improved grid that helps
aligning event triggers in the time axis. The user can create customised grid layouts to
support tuplets. Custom grids also support shuffled meter.
</p>

<p>
The audio synthesis editor has been extended to cover most aspects of instrument and
signal graph editing. We have combined the concepts of generator and DSP into a new kind
of signal processor. These processors can manipulate signals either separately or mixed
together. This approach allows for more flexibility in the way audio is synthesised while
keeping individual processors simple. Additionally, note pitch and force information is
now explicitly produced inside the instrument signal processing system. Finally, the
lowpass and stereo panning events have been replaced with more generic events that
control user-defined potentiometers of instruments and effects.
</p>

<p>
To forward the support of composing game music, we have reintroduced editor for
composition interactivity. The composer is now able to define environment variables that
can be used to alter the way music is played. This provides a convenient interface for
programmers who wish to control music playback without having to worry about the internal
structure of the music.
</p>

<h3>Kunquat 0.6.2</h3>
<p>2014-12-04</p>
<p>
In this release, the composition sheet returns with just enough support for creating
small polyphonic tunes. Note and rest editing is supported through both mouse and
keyboard. We have included a simple mixing graph editor together with limited support for
instrument editing. You can also save and load your work using the new <em>save</em> and
<em>open</em> buttons.
</p>

<p>
On the architectural side, we did some internal code refactoring as well as some small
adjustments to APIs. As a result, the Kunquat library API now reveals default values of
the rendering engine initialization set, removing the need to copy values over to tracker
code manually.
</p>

<p>
We also did a complete renewal of the build process and started using the
<em>fabricate</em> build tool. Therefore, you may wish to read the updated installation
instructions even if you have built Kunquat before.
</p>

<h3>Kunquat 0.6.1</h3>
<p>2014-03-18</p>
<p>
There has been silence for some time now when it comes to Kunquat releases. However, the
development side has been active during this non-break. We have moved development to
GitHub and upgraded our development process to match that.
</p>

<p>
Since the previous release we have rewritten the tracker several times to experiment with
different threading and programming models. While we have now found a model that seems to
work, the tracker has lost lots of features that need rewriting to match the new model.
We will be returning old features back one by one in future releases.
</p>

<p>
While many old features were lost in the architecture upgrade, the tracker also gained
some new features. The new release introduces an on-screen keyboard that visualizes
played notes with intense twinkle. Keyboard jamming is now a recognized use case and the
latency and performance of the tracker have been adjusted accordingly. The tracker
includes a log window that show what Kunquat events are fired in the background. In
addition, some performance measurements are displayed in the about window.
</p>

<p>
In addition to improvements in the tracker, we have also improved the API and
architecture of the Kunquat C library. It is now possible to get an estimate of the
duration of a Kunquat song without breaking the playback state. It is also possible to
retrieve all fired events regardless of how many events are fired at once. We also added
instrument controls that allow the user to rearrange their instruments more efficiently.
Finally, we rewrote the sequencer code to give us more flexibility when implementing new
features in the playback code.
