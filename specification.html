<h2>Kunquat, the Specification</h2>

<h3>State Machine</h3>

<p>
Kunquat audio rendering is based around a state machine and three factors: initialisation
set used to initialise the machine, audio rate used to control resolution of the
execution, and a stream of commands that is used to request audio from and to interact
with the state machine.
</p>

<p>
The state machine is initialised with a set of key/value pairs that define available
audio units (i.e. instrument and effects) and a connection graph that connects the
instruments through various effects to a stereo output. The initialisation data may also
contain an album of songs described as note data that can be used to control the audio
units without human intervention.
</p>

<p>
In addition to providing an initialisation set, the user needs to select an audio rate.
The audio rate affects the resolution at which the audio rendering and event processing
are done. A higher audio rate produces a more accurate estimation of the sound described
by the parameters and make it possible to interact with the state machine more tightly.
Specifying a lower audio rate reduces the amount of computation required.
</p>

<p>
Once the state machine has been initialised, the operation proceeds by feeding commands
to the state machine. The possible commands are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>render</code></dt>
<dd>
Produce a chunk of audio data together with information of any events that were processed
during the rendering of the audio chunk.
</dd>
<dt><code>fire</code><dt>
<dd>
Feed external events into the state machine.
</dd>
<dt><code>get_events</code></dt>
<dd>
Retrieve a set of events that were processed during the last call of <code>render</code>
or <code>fire</code>.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Event</h4>

<p>
The events fired by the state machine contain one or zero parameters. Firing an event
modifies the internal state of the state machine.
</p>

<h4>Trigger</h4>

<p>
Triggers are used for launching events in an automated fashion. A trigger consists of an
event name and an expression. Processing a trigger includes evaluating the expression and
launching an event with the value of the expression as a parameter.
</p>

<h4>Channel</h4>

<p>
Channels are numbers used for addressing audio unit controls. At any given time a channel
has one or zero selected note outputs and one or zero active audio units. Some channel
events affect the audio unit either directly or through the selected note output.
</p>

<h4>Environment</h4>

<p>
Environment is a variable space that can be used to parameterise parts of the automated
playback.
</p>

<h4>Connection Graph</h4>

<p>
Connection graph connects instruments through effects into master output.
</p>

<h4>Randomness</h4>

<p>
Kunquat composition defines a global random seed that is used to initialise random number
generators for various contexts at the start of playback.

<h3>Events</h3>

<p>
The events are categorised based on their scope and intended use.
</p>

<h4>About Slide Events</h4>

<p>
Some parameters in the playback state can be controlled with slides. Such parameters
include note force and pitch, among others. Most slides are specified with a slide target
event (denoted by forward slash ‘<strong>/</strong>’ in the event name) and a slide
length event (denoted by forward slash and equals sign ‘<strong>/=</strong>’ in the event
name). Oscillation parameter changes are always performed with slides (with slide length
of 0 by default), even though their slide target events are not named with the forward
slash.
</p>

<p>
The slide target event starts the slide progress from the current parameter value to the
target value. The slide is initialised with the length specified by the latest
corresponding slide length event, or length 0 if no length has been specified. However,
it is also possible to specify the slide length after the slide target in the same
trigger row. If a slide length is updated while the slide is in progress, the remaining
part of the slide will have the length specified by the new slide length event.
</p>

<p>
All slides are linear in the scale in which they are documented. For example, when a
force value is slid from 0 to -6 dBFS, the active force will be -3 dBFS exactly halfway
through the slide. Note, however, that tempo adjustments affect the speeds of all slides,
since the slide lengths are specified in timestamps.
</p>

<h4>Triggers for Name/Value Pair Control</h4>

<p>
Several events (stream, environment variable and device events) control values that are
specified with a name setting event (e.g. ‘<strong>.s</strong>’ modifies a stream whose
name is specified with ‘<strong>.sn</strong>’). For these event pairs, triggers support
syntactic sugar of the form <strong>[.s:foo x]</strong> that is equivalent to triggers
<strong>[.sn 'foo'] [.s x]</strong>.
</p>

<h4>Control Events</h4>

<p>
Control events are used for controlling generic playback-related behaviour. They are
mostly intended to be used by editors and, to certain extent, interactive compositions.
Most control events may cause infinite loops in compositions; therefore, control events
specified in triggers are ignored by default.
</p>

<table class="events">

<tr>
<th>cpause</th>
<td>
<h>Stop reading pattern data</h>
Stop the playback cursor. Active notes and effects will continue to be processed. New
events can only be fired through the external interface. This event has no effect if the
playback is already paused.
</td>
</tr>

<th>cresume</th>
<td>
<h>Continue reading pattern data</h>
Resume playback cursor movement. This event has no effect unless the playback is paused.
</td>

Jump to the beginning of pattern instance <var>x</var> and play that pattern instance in
an infinite loop. This is mostly intended to be used by editors.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>c.gp</th>
<td>
<h>Set unconditional jump target pattern instance <var>x</var></h>
Set target pattern instance <var>x</var> for event <strong>cg</strong>. This event does
not cause jumping by itself.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>c.gr</th>
<td>
<h>Set unconditional jump target row <var>x</var></h>
Set target row of timestamp <var>x</var> for event <strong>cg</strong>. This
event does not cause jumping by itself.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>cg</th>
<td>
<h>Jump unconditionally</h>
Jump to location specified by events <strong>c.gp</strong> and <strong>c.gr</strong>. If
the target pattern instance has not been specified, the first pattern instance of the
first song will be used. If the target row has not been specified, timestamp 0 will be
used.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>cinfinite+</th>
<td>
<h>Enable infinite playback mode</h>
By default, control events specified by triggers are ignored. This event will enable the
processing of such triggers. Note that, being a control event itself, this event must be
fired through the external interface to have an effect. Additionally, playback will jump
to the beginning of the specified song if the end is reached. This event has no effect if
the infinite playback mode is already enabled.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>cinfinite-</th>
<td>
<h>Disable infinite playback mode</h>
Disable control events caused by triggers and stop playback when the end of the specified
song is reached. Note that this effect will not disable pattern playback mode. This event
has no effect if the infinite playback mode is already disabled.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>c.evn</th>
<td>
<h>Select environment variable <var>x</var></h>
Select environment variable named <var>x</var> for storing a value.

<td>
<h>Set value <var>x</var> of selected environment variable</h>
Set value <var>x</var> of an environment variable. The variable name specified with the
last <strong>c.evn</strong> event in the current channel is used. This event has no
effect if the type of <var>x</var> is not compatible with the target environment
variable.

number of times specified by event <strong>m.jc</strong>.
When the jump event is processed normally, the current playback cursor position (pattern
instance, row timestamp, channel number and trigger row offset) is marked as a jump
position with the given jump counter. If a playback cursor location is marked as a jump
position, the possible corresponding mj trigger is ignored and the jump position is
processed. If the jump counter of a jump position is positive, the counter is decremented
by 1 and the jump is performed. If the counter is zero, the jump position information
will be removed.

<h>Slide tempo to <var>x</var></h>
Slide tempo to <var>x</var> beats per minute. Note that Kunquat implementations are
expressly allowed to perform tempo slides in a lower resolution than implied by the audio
rate, in order to simplify implementation of the sequencer.

<h4>Query Events</h4>

<p>
Query events are used to request information from the rendering engine.
</p>

<pre>
qlocation   Force generation of events Atrack, Asystem and Arow
qvoices     Force generation of event Avoices
qf          Force generation of event Af.
</pre>

<h4>Auto Events</h4>

<p>
Auto events fired with the fire command are ignored. The rendering engine creates auto
events to report updates in the playback status.
</p>

<pre>
Atrack      Do nothing with the current track number x.
Asystem     Do nothing with the current system number x.
Arow        Do nothing with the current pattern location timestamp x.
Avoices     Do nothing with the current active voice count x.
Af          Do nothing with the current actual force x of an active note.
</pre>

<h3>Appendix A: Module Format</h3>

<p>
The save feature in Kunquat Tracker stores initialization sets in zip files. Such saved
files are called Kunquat modules. The keys of the initialization set are presented as
file paths in the zip file and the values are stored as contents of the corresponding
files. In addition to the values required for playback, the tracker extends the
initialisation set with some metadata. See Appendix B for description of the metadata.
</p>

<h3>Appendix B: Metadata and Interface Data</h3>

<pre>
kqtc00/au_00/m_name.json    contains the name of the audio unit

kqtc00/m_authors.json
kqtc00/m_title.json

kqtc00/i_grid_enabled.json
kqtc00/i_grid_patterns.json
kqtc00/pat_000/i_base_grid.json
kqtc00/pat_000/col_00/i_overlay_grids.json
</pre>

<h3>Appendix C: Rendering Limitations</h3>

<p>
It is often desirable to specify limitations for rendering software. While implementing
Kunquat, we have specified such limits for the amount of polyphony, the amount of active
jump counters, the amount of nested ifs, the resolution of tempo slides, and the number
of unconditional jumps performed without rendering audio between the jumps.
</p>

<h3>Appendix D: Editing Behaviour</h3>

<p>
Editors may wish to change the initialization set during rendering. This may cause the
rendered sound to differ from the specified outcome during editing. In many cases this
could be reasonable trade-off as working with an editor is largely about modifying the
initialization set.
